# Workflows

This is a collection of workflows. When the user tells you to use one of these workflows YOU MUST FOLLOW ALL STEPS in the outlined order.

An example of the user specifying what workflow to use:
use workflow: standard. <task description comes afterwards>

## Standard

This is the most commonly used workflow and should be your default if in doubt.

Do not start implementing the task without explicitly being told by the user to do so.

1.  Think hard about the task given (collect context and get deep understanding)
2.  Ask the user questions if you have any doubts
3.  Provide the user with a 2-3 lines summary of your understading of the task. To continue to step 4 the user MUST APPROVE this understanding as correct.
4.  Generate a plan for how to implement the task and save it to task.md

## Prepared Task

This is used when there is a complete task outline in a task.md file.

1. Examine the content of the task.md file
2. Think hard about it and investigate files to gather context
3. Ask any questions you might have
4. Provide the user with a short summary of your understanding for approval BEFORE begining
5. Implement the prepared task once approval is given from user
