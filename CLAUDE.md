# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Guidelines

### DOs:
- Always use the code quality commands for testing your work
- Always use database commands for interacting with the database (migrations, queries)
- When need to use if statements, add an if for each condition

### DON'Ts:
- Do not build the application for testing purposes (go build)
- Do not add comments to the code as this is very bad practice
- Do not use if/else statements
- Do not use nested if/else statements

## Development Commands

### Application
- `just run` - Run the application with live reload watching for file changes
- `just run-app` - Run the application without live reload
- `just run-worker` - Run the background worker process
- `just run-email` - Run the email service with auto-reload

### Database
- `just create-migration name` - Create a new migration file
- `just migration-status` - Show the migration status
- `just up-migrations` - Run all pending migrations
- `just down-migrations` - Down all migrations
- `just reset-db` - Reset the database
- `just generate-db-functions` - Generate database functions with sqlc

### Templates and Assets
- `just compile-templates` - Compile templ templates
- `just fmt-templates` - Format templ templates

### Code Quality
- `just golangci` (alias: `just ci`) - Run golangci-lint
- `just vet` - Run go vet

### Testing
- `just test-units` (alias: `just tu`) - Run unit tests
- `just test-integrations` (alias: `just ti`) - Run integration tests
- `just test-e2e` - Run end-to-end tests
- `just test-all` - Run all tests

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **HTTP Server**
   - Based on Echo framework
   - Located in `server/http.go`
   - Handles graceful shutdown

2. **Router**
   - Defined in `router/router.go`
   - Sets up all routes through `SetupRoutes`
   - Uses middleware for sessions, contexts, etc.
   - Routes are organized into groups in `router/routes/`

3. **Handlers**
   - Located in `handlers/`
   - Handle HTTP requests and map to service operations
   - Use templ for HTML rendering

4. **Models**
   - Located in `models/`
   - Represent domain entities (User, Token)
   - Include validation and business logic
   - Use sqlc-generated code for database operations

5. **Database**
   - PostgreSQL with sqlc for type-safe queries
   - Migrations using goose
   - Model definitions in `psql/migrations/`

6. **Services**
   - Located in `services/`
   - Business logic layer
   - Authentication, registration, etc.

7. **Background Processing**
   - Uses River queue (PostgreSQL-backed)
   - Workers for email sending, etc.
   - Defined in `psql/queue/`

8. **Templates**
   - Uses templ for type-safe templates
   - Views in `views/`
   - Components in `views/internal/components/`
   - Layouts in `views/internal/layouts/`

9. **Configuration**
   - Environment-based configuration in `config/`
   - Uses env variables with `caarlos0/env/v10`

### Request Flow

1. HTTP request → Echo router
2. Router middleware (sessions, context, etc.)
3. Route handler
4. Service/model business logic
5. Database operations
6. HTML rendering with templ
7. HTTP response

## Key Dependencies

- Echo - Web framework
- templ - Type-safe templates
- sqlc - Type-safe SQL
- River - Background job processing
- gorilla/sessions - Session management
- pgx - PostgreSQL driver
