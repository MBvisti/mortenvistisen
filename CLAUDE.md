# Workflow

This is always the workflow you should use unless you are given a task.md file that clearly outlines a task.

1.  Think hard about the task given (collect context and get deep understanding)
2.  Ask the user questions if you have any doubts
3.  Provide the user with a 2-3 lines summary of how you understand the task
3a. The user must approve or agree that your summar is correct before continuing to step 4
4.  Generate a plan for how to implement the task
5.  Once satisfied with the plan, save it to task.md in the root of the project
